#**Traffic Sign Recognition** 

---

**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points
###Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
###Writeup / README

####1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.

You're reading it! and here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/AlexSchizoid/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)

###Data Set Summary & Exploration

####1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used the Pyhton's functionality to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

####2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

For the exploratory visualization part i decided to see how the various classes are distributed in the dataset. As the bar chart shows some classes are smaller than others which could possibly lead to overfitting. A solution for this might pe equalizing the number of samples per class, by fetching more examples are generating extra samples. 

The three datasets seem to have similar distributions.

###Design and Test a Model Architecture

####1. I have decided to test 3 kind of scenarios for preprocessing and in the end choose the one that seems to be working the best. 
In the first scenario, I decided to keep the samples as is, no preprocessing.
In the second scenario, I decided to keep the samples in color, but apply Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization(CLAHE) to the Y channel of the image after converting the samples from RGB to YUV. This should create better edges for the road signs. The Last step is to convert the sample back to RGB.
In the third scenario,  the samples are grayscaled and then I apply CLAHE for the same reason as above.

The following plot shows that the second scenario seems to work a little bit better than the others, so I've chosen this method for the preprocessing step.

####2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x3 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 3x3     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 32x32x64 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 16x16x64 				|
| Convolution 3x3	    | etc.      									|
| Fully connected		| etc.        									|
| Softmax				| etc.        									|
|						|												|
